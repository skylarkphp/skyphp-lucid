Installing From Source
======================

**Note:** The development version of Lucid is cutting/bleeding edge software. You should not use it unless you know what you are doing. You have been warned.

Checking out source code from Git
=================================
In order to get a copy of Lucid's source code, you must have Git_. installed.

.. _Git: http://www.git-scm.com/

Our Git repository is located at http://github.com/lucid/lucid/tree/master

To check out a copy, run this command:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    git clone git://github.com/lucid/lucid.git lucid

Building
========
Unless you plan on installing Lucid Desktop locally, you should build it. This compresses the javascript that is sent to the client so the desktop will load faster.
From a terminal, navigate to the ``/desktop/dojotoolkit/util/buildscripts/`` directory. Then run this command (for windows run build.bat instead of build.sh):

.. code-block:: bash
    
    ./build.sh profile=desktop action=release mini=true

If you want to prevent the buildscripts from making un-necesary ammounts of optimizing of non-existant translations, you can add the following to the command (it saves a significant ammount of disk space):

.. code-block:: bash

   localeList="en-gb,en-us,es-es,fr-fr"

Then, copy all contents of ``/desktop/dojotoolkit/release/dojo/`` to ``/desktop/dojotoolkit/``, and delete the release directory.

If you want to make updating in the future easier, you can edit the paths of the ``<script>`` tags on both ``index.html`` and ``desktop/index.html`` to point to the javascript files in the release directory. Also fix the paths in ``desktop/dojotoolkit/lucid/login/Form.js``.

Note that if you do a git pull, and anything in the ``/desktop/dojotoolkit/`` directory is updated, you must rebuild and clear your cache.

Installation
============
From here, you can follow the :ref:`installation instructions <user-install-instructions>` to get everything set up.
