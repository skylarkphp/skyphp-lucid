Application Structure
=====================
Applications are Dojo modules
=============================
Lucid applications are essentially dojo modules. They live in the ``desktop.apps`` namespace. The name of the module in this namespace is known as the application's system name, or sysname. All applications extend the ``desktop.apps._App`` class, which contains some bootstrap code and self-management functions.

Metadata
========
Each app has metadata associated with it, which is stored in the database. This tells Lucid what category it is, which file types it can open, and other things.

Application Skeleton
====================
TODO: provide an example app that kills itself, walk through what happens

File layout
===========
The layout for applications consists of the following:

    SysName/
    SysName.js

SysName being the sysname of your application. Depending on how complex your application is, you can take two routes when choosing a layout.

Single-file applications
------------------------
These are good for quick applications that don't do much.

TODO: provide examples, elaborate

Multiple-file applications
--------------------------
TODO: talk about how it makes it easy to maintain, how to break it up using dojo.extend, etc.

Accessing files/backends bundled with an application
----------------------------------------------------
You can get the path to scripts, images, audio, etc. using ``dojo.moduleUrl``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var soundPath = dojo.moduleUrl("desktop.apps.SystemName", "resources/sound.mp3");


Note that some APIs (such as the Sound API) require that you pass a string. Since moduleUrl returns an object containing a toString method, you need to pass the ``uri`` property of the object returned.

.. code-block:: javascript
    
    soundPath = soundPath.uri;

When used in conjunction with the ``desktop.xhr`` method, you can make calls to custom backends packaged with your app this way.

.. code-block:: javascript

   desktop.xhr({
       url: dojo.moduleUrl("desktop.apps.SystemName", "backends/someFile.php"),
       load: function(data){
           console.log("Returned from backend: "+data);
       }
   })
